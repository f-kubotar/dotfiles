--- cycle {|obj| block }

Calls block for each element of enum repeatedly forever. Returns
nil if and only if the collection is empty. Enumerable#cycle
saves elements in an internal array so changes to enum after
the first pass have no effect.

   a = ["a", "b", "c"]
   a.cycle {|x| puts x }  # print, a, b, c, a, b, c,.. forever.
