--- nsec    -> Integer
--- tv_nsec -> Integer

Returns just the number of nanoseconds for time.

   t = Time.now        #=> 2007-11-17 15:18:03 +0900
   "%10.9f" % t.to_f   #=> "1195280283.536151409"
   t.nsec              #=> 536151406

The lowest digit of to_f and nsec is different because IEEE 754
double is not accurate enough to represent nanoseconds from the
Epoch. The accurate value is returned by nsec.
