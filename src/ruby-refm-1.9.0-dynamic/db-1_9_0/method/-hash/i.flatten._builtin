--- flatten -> Array
--- flatten(level) -> Array

Returns a new array that is a one-dimensional flattening of this
hash. That is, for every key or value that is an array, extract
its elements into the new array. Unlike Array#flatten, this method
does not flatten recursively by default. If the optional level
argument determins the level of recursion to flatten.

   a =  {1=> "one", 2 => [2,"two"], 3 => "three"}
   a.flatten    # => [1, "one", 2, [2, "two"], 3, "three"]
   a.flatten(2) # => [1, "one", 2, 2, "two", 3, "three"]
